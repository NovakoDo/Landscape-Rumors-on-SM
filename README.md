# Landscape-Rumors-on-SM
This project is conducted as part of my bachelor thesis addressing the challenge of rumors on Social Media. 
Rumors on Social Media is a broad and challenging topic to discuss and research on, starting at analyzing rumor diffusion patterns to automated detection and machine learning techniques. The objective of the thesis was to give a comprehensive overview and a basis understanding of the terminology used to further study this topic and of launched projects and reasercher groups developing and training veracity intelligent algorithms and rumor detection tools. 
Information and data explaining and discussing some fundamental terms, current projects, publications and proposed approaches are collected from research papers and surveys and are modeled into a rumor landscape. This form of literature review supports the understanding of how this data is linked together and enables the extraction of information for further research. However, the annotation process was performed manually. This thesis focuses only on modeling a knowledge graph, by linking information and showing existing relations between approaches, research projects and publications. 
The author uses RDF-Triples to model a relation between subjects and objects. These RDF-statements are then visualized with GEPHI, an open software tool for graph visualization.
